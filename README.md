# sas-code-examples

This repository provides a collection of example SAS programs. Each program is stand-alone, so it can be excuted in your SAS execution environment of choice to view the log and results. 

Instructions for creating sample programs:
1. Use the following comment template at the top of the program.
2. Each program should be able to copy/paste into any instance of SAS and execute successfully. If there are exceptions or requirements, they should be noted in the comment. 
3. When possible, use SASHELP tables. If you need to use other data, include the creation of the table using a DATA step with DATALINES.
