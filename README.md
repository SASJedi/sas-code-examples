# SAS-code-examples

This repository provides a collection of example SAS programs. Each program is stand-alone, so it can be excuted to view the log and results. 

Instructions for creating sample programs:
1. Use the following comment template at the top of the program.
2. Each program should be able to copy/paste into any instance of SAS and execute successfully.
3. When possible, use SASHELP tables. If you need to use other data, include the creation of the table using a DATA step with DATALINES.
